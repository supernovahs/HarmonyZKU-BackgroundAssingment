 A.) Conceptual Knowledge: Explaining Concepts to a 5 year old!
 
 Q1) What is a smart contract? How are they deployed? You should be able to describe how a smart contract is deployed and the necessary steps. 

Answer:  Smart contract is a program which anyone can create and can never be changed. You can tell the smart contract to do something for you and he will always listen to you(If you wrote it correctly!).

There is something called a blockchain. It stores every transaction. To start(aka deploy) the contract, you have to talk to the blockchain using something called a node. There are thousands of Nodes , you have to talk anyone of them.  
You need to have an account for deploying your contract.  Creating an account is free. To deploy, you have to give a fees to the blockchain , in return of deploying. 

Q2) What is gas? Why is gas optimization such a big focus when building smart contracts?

Answer: Nothing is free in this world. Blockchain is updated and maintained by Nodes(which are just a normal computer running some software). Hence , users of blockchain  pay some fees to the network in return of their data security. 
This fees is called Gas. 
Like car needs Gas, Blockchain also needs fuel to keep running. 
Gas optimization means writing contracts in such a way that your transactions cost is least possible. This results in savings to user. And who doesn't wants discount. 
Big contracts can save thousands of dollars in gas if they focus on gas Optimizations. Hence a very important part.

Q3)What is a hash? Why do people use hashing to hide information?

Answer: Suppose you know want to share a secret to your friend . You can change the message to some secret code that only she knows. Hashing is also somewhat similar. 
You can hash the message and only the authorized person can know what was actually written. 
It's a great tool. Think , You could hash your personal info and only you could open it . With a simple computer program.

Q4)How would you prove to a colorblind person that two different colored objects are actually of different colors?
